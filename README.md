# Augmented-Accessory-Visualizer
Welcome to the Augmented-Accessory-Visualizer repository! This project is an augmented reality (AR) furniture visualization tool developed as part of my Augmented and Virtual Reality course. The tool allows users to interact with and visualize 3D furniture models in real-world environments using Meta Spark and Lens Studio.

## Project Overview
The Augmented-Accessory-Visualizer project aims to provide an immersive AR experience by integrating furniture models into real-world environments. The project was developed using Meta Spark Studio and Lens Studio, employing model files created with Blender.

## Features:
### Meta Spark
+ 3D Models: Includes 3D models of furniture (tables, chairs) created using Blender.
+ UI Picker: Allows users to switch between different furniture items.
+ Interactive Controls: Users can rotate and scale the augmented items to visualize them in their space.

### Lens Studio
+ 3D Models: Similar models as in Meta Spark.
+ Tap to Change: Allows users to tap on the screen to switch between furniture items. (UI Picker not included)
+ Incomplete Implementation: The Lens Studio version is a work in progress.

# Setup and Installation
To get started with the Augmented-Accessory-Visualizer, follow these steps:

## Meta Spark:
+ Navigate to the Meta Spark Directory(Accessory Visualizer Using Meta Spark).
+ Open Meta Spark Studio and load the project files.
## Lens Studio:
+ Unzip the Accessory Visualizer Using Lens Studio file(Lens Studio Project).
+ Open Lens Studio and load the project from the unzipped directory.

## Usage
### Meta Spark Usage:
+ Open the project in Meta Spark Studio.
+ Use the UI Picker to select different furniture items.
+ Interact with the models by rotating and scaling them to fit in your environment.
### Lens Studio Usage:
+ Open the project in Lens Studio.
+ Tap on the screen to change between different furniture items.
  
## Challenges and Solutions
During the development process, several challenges were encountered, particularly in accurate plane tracking within Meta Spark Studio. This led to the exploration of Lens Studio as an alternative, which offered a different interaction functionality but remains incomplete.
